========================
 
Hungry Birds is a classical example of producer/consumer problem.
I have used different software skills to resolve this problem.


=== SOLUTION ===

First Solution	
	Folder:	Thread/
	Topic: 	In this case Thread Concepts are been used.
		In particular, the program uses multi-thread and shared 
		global variable.
			
Second Solution	
	Folder:	Process/
	Topic: 	In this case Process Concepts are been used.
		The application uses a different Process for any element
		of the problem with exception of the worms' plate, for 
		that element, a shared kernel memory is been used.
		There are two version of the program: one with a single 
		"exe" file, other with a parent and a child executable file.
